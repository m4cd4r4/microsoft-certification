## üñ•Ô∏è Hardware & System Compatibility

### 1. TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot Requirements
Windows 11's requirement for [TPM 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/tpm-recommendations) and [UEFI with Secure Boot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-secure-boot) is the biggest roadblock for many organizations. Legacy devices simply cannot upgrade, forcing expensive hardware refresh decisions.

**Solution:** Conduct a comprehensive hardware inventory early. Plan your device refresh strategy around business priorities, not just technical requirements. For critical legacy systems, consider registry bypasses only for temporary solutions (not recommended for production).

### 2. CPU Compatibility and Performance
[Windows 11's strict CPU requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/windows-11-requirements) (8th generation Intel or 2nd generation AMD Ryzen minimum) eliminate many otherwise capable devices from consideration.

**Solution:** Perform thorough hardware assessments and benchmark testing. Consider a staged rollout that prioritizes newer devices first, allowing budget time to refresh incompatible hardware.

### 3. Legacy Application Compatibility
Older line-of-business applications may fail on Windows 11 due to [compatibility changes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/windows-11), potentially disrupting critical business operations.

**Solution:** Implement comprehensive [application compatibility testing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/planning/windows-11-plan-app-compatibility). Consider virtualization solutions for problematic applications and engage vendors early for compatibility updates.

### 4. Virtualization and Hyper-V Compatibility
[Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/) requirements in Windows 11 can conflict with existing virtualization platforms and security software.

**Solution:** Test all virtualization scenarios thoroughly. Configure [virtualization-based security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/device-guard/introduction-to-device-guard-virtualization-based-security-and-windows-defender-application-control) appropriately and establish clear exclusion policies for compatibility.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Cloud Infrastructure

### 5. Network Connectivity and Bandwidth
Insufficient bandwidth and latency issues can cripple user experience when moving to cloud services. [Azure connectivity architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/) changes everything about network planning.

**Solution:** Conduct thorough network assessments before migration. Consider [ExpressRoute implementation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/) for critical connections and optimize bandwidth allocation based on usage patterns.

### 6. Data Migration and Synchronization
Moving large volumes of corporate data to Azure while maintaining accessibility presents significant challenges. [Azure data migration tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-migration-overview) help, but planning is crucial.

**Solution:** Implement phased migration approaches. Use [Azure File Sync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/file-sync/file-sync-introduction) for gradual transitions and establish robust backup verification strategies.

### 7. Hybrid Scenarios and Coexistence
Managing mixed environments with [hybrid management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/comanage/) between on-premises and cloud resources increases complexity exponentially.

**Solution:** Develop clear [hybrid management strategies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/comanage/overview) with defined governance policies. Plan for longer coexistence periods than initially anticipated.

### 8. VPN and Remote Access Configuration
Traditional VPN solutions must transition to [Azure VPN Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/) and [Always On VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-access/vpn/always-on-vpn/) configurations.

**Solution:** Carefully configure [VPN profiles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/vpn/vpn-guide), manage certificate lifecycles, and conduct extensive connection testing across various scenarios.

### 9. Backup and Disaster Recovery
Moving from on-premises backup solutions to [Azure Backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/) requires completely rethinking disaster recovery strategies.
